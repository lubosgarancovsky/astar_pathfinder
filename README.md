This repository contains a visualisation tool for the A* pathfinding algorithm implemented in JavaScript. The algorithm finds the shortest path between two points on a grid, taking into account obstacles that might be present.

The tool provides a graphical representation of the grid, with obstacles represented as walls and the start and end points as distinct colours. The algorithm is animated so that the user can see how it progresses through the grid.

To run the visualiser, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js installed, you can use the following commands to run the visualiser:

bash

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the visualiser
npm run dev

This will start a development server at http://localhost:3000 where you can view the visualisation in your browser.

Feel free to use this code for your own projects or to contribute to the repository. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please open an issue or a pull request.
