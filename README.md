This repository contains a visualisation tool for the A* pathfinding algorithm implemented in JavaScript. The algorithm finds the shortest path between two points on a grid, taking into account obstacles that might be present.

The tool provides a graphical representation of the grid, with obstacles represented as walls and the start and end points as distinct colours. The algorithm is animated so that the user can see how it progresses through the grid.
